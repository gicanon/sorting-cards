# Data Sort Using Cards

Suppose you are sorting a set of cards. The right hand holds several cards which are sequentially sorted by numbers arranged from right to left, say for example, five cards with 10, 6, 5, 3, 2 arranged from right to left. Your left hand is picking up the top card from a pile of card deck. Now you insert the card that you have picked from the pile of deck into the right position within the right-hand cards, in a sorted order from right to left.
